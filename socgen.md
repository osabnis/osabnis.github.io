# My Work at Societe Generale as a Data Scientist

## 1. Veritrade

</div>

* Veritrade is a solution to automate trade finance verification. The solution uses state of the art deep learning to first identify the type of documents 
  from 23 different categories like Bill of Lading, Letter of Credit, Invoice, etc. 
* Once a document is classified the solution extracts critical information like issue date, type of commodity, billing address, etc from each of those 23 documents 
  using a hybrid approach comprising of both machine learning and heuristics. 
* The information extraction approach is robust enough to handle different variations across the same documents. 
* The solution then runs around 4000 consistency checks and rules specified by UCP and ISBP. The rules and consistency checks can be intra and inter documents.
* Advantages of Veritrade:
  * Massive efficiency gains of ~80%
  * Drastically reduces the operational risk
  * Brings objectivity to the UCP/ISBP rules
  * Flexible to quickly adapt to any UCP/ISBP rules
  * Eliminates training cost
* As a part of the team, I developed a new feature - a pilot meaning representation module that uses deep learning to convert semantically similar but syntactically different natural language statements into a standard logical form that a computer system can understand and execute. This feature wasn’t present neither in Veritrade nor in its competitors.
  

## 2. Sceptre

</div>
* Sceptre is a platform built for conducting AI/ML related experiments. 
* On-fly OCR functionality with the option to choose Tesseract (Open source) Engine, ABBYY Engine, or Azure OCR. 
* Ability to create multiple projects with different versions and tag documents on the platform itself for recognition and extraction purpose. 
* The platform lets users choose different algorithms for document extraction and define business-specific heuristics. 
* The platform can also run multiple consistency checks and rules specified by the business. 
* Finally, the platform will list down the documents where some validation failed and requires additional review.
* As part of the project, I was in the Training APIs team where we aimed at building a framework that can be deployed with Sceptre for training and evaluating deep learning based model. I worked on developing the resource management component, model storage and versioning component and model evaluation component for the framework.


## 3. MAX

</div>
* MAX is an artificial intelligent Conversation UX that understands natural language through voice and text. 
* It engages in a conversation with a user, understands his/her intent, and helps user performing actions by connecting to relevant applications through APIs. 
* It is a zero coding system and enables businesses to add new use cases(conversation)) on their own. 
* The product won the <a href="https://nasscom.in/knowledge-center/publications/top-50-ai-game-changers-compendium-best-ai-solutions-use-cases" target="_blank">NASSCOM Top 50 AI Game Changers award.</a>
* I was a part of a 2 member AI team that developed and deployed MAX for ALD Automotive, Mumbai - a leading car leasing company. The process involved designing conversational flow for the client, training deep learning models to identify customer intent and concepts   from customer queries and deploying MAX on the customer’s servers after testing. The deployment will help reduce employee costs by around 50% and provide 24x7 support for the client by helping schedule appointments for vehicle servicing and repair.


## SEMSE
<div align="center">
    <img alt="Logo" src="https://github.com/osabnis/osabnis.github.io/blob/master/images/semse.jpg" width="300" />
</div>
* Semse is a search tool that extracts business knowledge trapped inside thousands of documents by mitigating users’ struggle of finding information that they are looking for.
* Semse uses all documents in as-is, where-is basis. It automatically learns entire knowledge from all the documents using state of the art deep learning techniques. 
* It is a language-independent search engine that lets users ask questions in any language. 
* It reduces the manual efforts of preparing training data and organizing questions from users. 
* It also uses iterative learning and continuously evolves based on usage.
* As part of the SEMSE team, I was involved in improving the model architectures used within the product for improved performance and demo-ing the product to various clients.

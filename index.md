# About Me!

Hello! I am currently a graduate student pursuing my **Master of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Data Science** from the _University of Southern California_. I completed my **Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science specializing in Bioinformatics** in 2020 from _Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore_  with a GPA of **9.49** and graduated as a **bronze medallist**.

Here is a list of the skills that I am proficient in!
* AI: Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision
* Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Clustering Algorithms, Neural Networks, Ensemble Methods
* Computer Science: Data and Web Mining, High Performance Computing, Data Visualization, Internet of Things
* Biology: Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics
* Mathematics: Statistics, Differential Equations, Optimizations, Linear Algebra
* Development: Git, FastAPI, Flask, Django
* Languages: Python, Java, R

When I am not in front of the computer screen, I am probably playing video games, exploring space through my telescope or eating and hopefully cooking some of my favorite foods!

# Where I have worked!

I have worked in these amazing companies in the past!

**Societe Generale** - _Artificial Intelligence Team - Innovations Group_
* At SocGen, I was part of the Veritrade team, where I developed a new feature - a pilot meaning representation module that uses deep
  learning to convert semantically similar but syntactically different natural language statements into a standard logical
  form that a computer system can understand and execute. This feature wasn’t present neither in Veritrade nor in its competitors.
  Veritrade is an AI based solution that automates the process of Letter of Credit based International Trade document
  verification and validation against International standards using Deep Learning.
* I was also a  member of the AI team that developed the deep learning framework for Sceptre - a document understanding
  platform. I worked on developing the resource management component, model storage and versioning component and
  model evaluation component for the platform. The platform aims at simplifying the training and evaluation of AI models
  on documents by presenting a no-code UI to the business - for faster and easier AI development and deployment.
* I was a part of a 2 member AI team that developed and deployed MAX - a deep learning based conversational agent
  developed by Societe Generale - for ALD Automotive, Mumbai - a leading car leasing company. The process involved
  designing conversational flow for the client, training deep learning models to identify customer intent and concepts
  from customer queries and deploying MAX on the customer’s servers after testing. The deployment will help reduce
  employee costs by around 50 percent and provide 24x7 support for the client by helping schedule appointments for
  vehicle servicing and repair.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

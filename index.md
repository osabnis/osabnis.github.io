# About Me!

Hello! I am currently a graduate student pursuing my **Master of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Data Science** from the _University of Southern California_. I completed my **Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science specializing in Bioinformatics** in 2020 from _Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore_  with a GPA of **9.49** and graduated as a **bronze medallist**.

Here is a list of the skills that I am proficient in!
* AI: Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision
* Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Clustering Algorithms, Neural Networks, Ensemble Methods
* Computer Science: Data and Web Mining, High Performance Computing, Data Visualization, Internet of Things
* Biology: Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics
* Mathematics: Statistics, Differential Equations, Optimizations, Linear Algebra
* Development: Git, FastAPI, Flask, Django
* Languages: Python, Java, R

When I am not in front of the computer screen, I am probably playing video games, exploring space through my telescope or eating and hopefully cooking some of my favorite foods!

# Where I have worked!

I have worked in these amazing companies in the past!

**Societe Generale, India** - _Artificial Intelligence Team - Innovations Group_
* At SocGen, I was part of the Veritrade team, where I developed a new feature - a pilot meaning representation module that uses deep
  learning to convert semantically similar but syntactically different natural language statements into a standard logical
  form that a computer system can understand and execute. This feature wasn’t present neither in Veritrade nor in its competitors.
  Veritrade is an AI based solution that automates the process of Letter of Credit based International Trade document
  verification and validation against International standards using Deep Learning and aims at improving the speed of document checking by almost 60%.
* I was also a  member of the AI team that developed the deep learning framework for Sceptre - a document understanding
  platform. I worked on developing the resource management component, model storage and versioning component and
  model evaluation component for the platform. The platform aims at simplifying the training and evaluation of AI models
  on documents by presenting a no-code UI to the business - for faster and easier AI development and deployment.
* I was a part of a 2 member AI team that developed and deployed MAX - a deep learning based conversational agent
  developed by Societe Generale - for ALD Automotive, Mumbai - a leading car leasing company. The process involved
  designing conversational flow for the client, training deep learning models to identify customer intent and concepts
  from customer queries and deploying MAX on the customer’s servers after testing. The deployment will help reduce
  employee costs by around 50% and provide 24x7 support for the client by helping schedule appointments for
  vehicle servicing and repair.
  
**SigTuple Technologies, India** - _Data Science Team_
* At SigTuple as an intern, I developed a Deep Learning pipeline to diagnose Tuberculosis on SigTuple’s AI100 and AI101 diagnostic machines - the
  goal is to reduce the diagnostic time by almost 90% and improve the accuracy of TB Sputum Smear Test by over 50%.
* I also deployed a pipeline based on the Yolo architecture, which was able to grade FOVs for tuberculosis with an exact match
  in 161 FOV out of 185 taken from over 15 patients to the ground-truth established by a certified pathologist. The pipeline
  is currently in production.
* I was also involved in building a super-resolution pipeline using convolutional autoencoders which was able to increase the resolution of a 40x
  image to that of a 100x image. This was required as the pathology machines do not come equipped with 100x lens. It has
  helped improve the speed and accuracy of annotating the image data by almost 40%, both for the tuberculosis pipeline and other pipelines in the
  company.

**Mazumdar Shaw Center for Translational Research, India** - _Neuro-Oncology Department_
* At MSCTR, I had the opportunity to work under Dr. Nameeta Shah - one of the leading scientists in the domain of neuro-oncology. Here I worked on analyzing of Copy Number Variation Data and DNA Methylation Data for Finding Useful Biomarkers in Glioblastoma Multiforme, which is an aggressive brain cancer. I was able to find 15 significant genetic variations on analyzing 563 patient samples that help in predicting patient prognosis like ’Time to Death’ and ’Age of Occurrence.’
* Applied a similar analysis pipeline to Lower Grade Gliomas, which are lesser dangerous tumours. I was able to find 12
  significant genetic variations on analyzing 958 patient samples that help in predicting patient prognosis like ’Time to
  Death’, ’Age of Occurrence’ and ’Histological Type.’
* Also contributed to a publication – ‘Recursive Consensus Clustering’ – a novel algorithm designed at the institute by
  doing algorithm analysis, testing and hosting the visualizations on a website. The paper can be found at - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67016-3
  
**Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India** - _Department of Computer Science and Automation_

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

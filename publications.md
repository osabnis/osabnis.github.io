**Abstract**

_Background and aims:_ Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. Hydrogen sulphide plays an important role in reduc-ing oxidative stress. Several studies demonstrated that hydrogen sulphide protects islet beta cells from oxidant stress damage and decreases apoptosis. The aim of the work is to investigate the effect of hydrogen sulphide donor on heart functions and endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic smooth muscle in diabetes.

_Materials and methods:_ Rats were divided into control and diabetic groups. Diabetes mellitus was induced with a single intraperitoneally injection of streptozo-tocin (60mg/kg). The functional cardiohemodynamic indicators were registered via microcatheter and Pressure-Volume System. The sodium hydrosulphide NaHS (15.8mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. The contractile activity of the muscle preparations of the thoracic aorta was recorded using a strain gauge. <br>

_Results:_ We demonstrate that the NaHS improves pumping function and restores diastolic heart function in streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetes rats. We show that pretreatment with NaHS increased the stroke volume by 43.1%, and the ejection fraction increased by 48.64%. NaHS improves the ventriculo-arterial coupling and increases by 3.4 times acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the aorta in diabetic rats. The inhibition of NOS activity by blocker L-NAME abolished NaHS-mediated va-sodilatation in the intact endothelium of the aorta in diabetes. It indicates that the NaHS caused vasodilatation by a NOS-dependent mechanism.

_Conclusion:_ The exogenous hydrogen sulphide can improve pumping function and restore diastolic heart function in diabetes. The pretreatment with NaHS can prevent endothelial dysfunction in diabetes due to the NOS-dependent mechanism.

**Abstract**
In this technological era, we have seen a huge increase in the number of reviewing sites in the internet. In case of online food delivery stores, these reviews are very important as they, on the whole express public sentiment towards a particular restaurant or cuisine. In this paper, we are proposing an approach to predict which cuisines and restaurants are “trending” in a country based on the analysis of social media. We mine social media platforms like Twitter for food-related tweets and extract these tweets by using our own manually curated food lexicon. From these tweets, we use similarity matching to extract the food items that were tweeted about and run each of these items through a cuisine classifier based on logistic regression and word2vec word embeddings. This is done for all the tweets and thus, we can get which cuisines and restaurants have been popular while, which restaurants are fading. Our approach can, therefore be used by restaurants to analyze which markets they need to expand into and also where they have to revamp their business strategies.
